      <description>Introduction After Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-work (PoW) to Proof-of-stake (PoS), validators replaced miners as the key role in the network. The idea of Proposer / Builder Separation (PBS) is to split validators into two roles, Builder and Proposer, to mitigate MEV&amp;rsquo;s negative impact. Currently, PBS is mainly implemented by MEV-Boost, and in the future, PBS will be built into the Ethereum protocol. This report will introduce PBS&amp;rsquo;s mechanism and discuss its current situation and future.</description>
